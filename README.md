"This repository contains the files: scraper.py, ufc_odds.py, and hola_bud.py, all of which use some sort of web scraping method. ufc_odds.py is a web scraping program that is made for the website http://www.foxsports.com/ufc/odds. This file uses pandas to extract the data from foxsports.com. Pandas is used because it extracts the data as a dataframe which made manipulating the data much easier. The same code in ufc_odds.py can be found in scraper.py in addition to different examples of how to use beautifulsoup to retrieve the data. hola_bud.py also uses beautifulsoup to retrieve its data. This file was created because I wanted to find out which episodes and how many times in each episode was a certain line spoken. To do this, I utilized the website http://www.springfieldspringfield.co.uk, which is a TV and Movie transcript database. With a few adjustments to the code, any show or movie featured on that website can be searched through, even episode by episode, to find a specific line or quote, and will give you a very rough estimate for the time at which the line is spoken."
